# KoeLingo Implementation Plan

## 1. Development Approach

The implementation follows a function-focused, incremental development approach that ensures each capability is fully verified before moving to the next. This strategy minimizes risk and allows for early detection of potential issues.

Key principles:
- Develop core functionality in Python first for rapid prototyping and validation
- Port performance-critical components to C++ once functionality is verified
- Maintain comprehensive testing between phases
- Establish clear verification criteria for each phase

## 2. Development Phases

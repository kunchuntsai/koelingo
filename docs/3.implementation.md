# KoeLingo Implementation Plan

## 1. Development Approach

The implementation follows a function-focused, incremental development approach that ensures each capability is fully verified before moving to the next. This strategy minimizes risk and allows for early detection of potential issues.

Key principles:
- Develop core functionality in Python first for rapid prototyping and validation
- Port performance-critical components to C++ once functionality is verified
- Maintain comprehensive testing between phases
- Establish clear verification criteria for each phase

## 2. Development Phases

### 2.1 Phase 1: Audio Capture & Visualization
- âœ… Set up development environment for Python and C++
- âœ… Create initial project structure and Python modules
- âœ… Create initial binding layer with pybind11
- âœ… Implement basic UI shell with microphone status indicator
- âœ… Develop audio capture in Python for prototype testing
- âœ… Verify audio capture works correctly with visualization
- âœ… Port verified audio capture to C++ with Python bindings
- âœ… Test and validate C++ audio implementation matches Python prototype
- âœ… Implement custom test runner with formatted output
- **Verified Capability**: Audio capture and level visualization

### 2.2 Phase 2: Speech-to-Text Baseline
- âœ… Integrate basic Whisper model for Japanese transcription
- âœ… Implement text display panel in UI
- âœ… Create simple pipeline: Audio â†’ Whisper â†’ Text display
- âœ… Verify Japanese audio input is correctly received and processed by STT model
- âœ… Implement speech confidence indicators

- **Verified Capability**: Continuous real-time transcription

### 2.4 Phase 4: Translation Integration
- ðŸ”„ Implement NLLB translation engine
- âœ… Create English text display panel
- âœ… Develop synchronized text display (Japanese/English)
- ðŸ”„ Test translation accuracy and performance
- ðŸ”„ Optimize translation with CTranslate2
- ðŸ”„ Implement auto-saving functionality
- **Current Status**: Basic UI for translation display is complete, but using simulated translation (placeholder) until the actual translation module is implemented

### 2.5 Phase 5: Full System & Optimization
- ðŸ”„ Implement document saving functionality
- ðŸ”„ Add application settings and configuration
- ðŸ”„ Develop error handling and recovery mechanisms
- ðŸ”„ Perform end-to-end system testing
- ðŸ”„ Optimize memory usage and performance
- ðŸ”„ Conduct user acceptance testing
- ðŸ”„ Create final documentation and packaging
- **Current Status**: Not yet started

Each phase builds upon verified functionality from previous phases. Testing occurs at the end of each phase to ensure the functionality meets requirements before proceeding.
